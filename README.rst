VMak - log parsing and reading project for Quantum Service
========================

This project is the start of a product that is the brain child of Ryan Davies. The primary engine for this system is using the ELK stack
and the initial purpose is to provide a tool with the ability to immediately increase productivity for analyzing all Quantum product logs
and the long term ability to parse and visualize log patterns that may or may not be valuable to the business and/or service organization.
